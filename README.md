#### Hi everyone!

Mi name is Pablo Magari√±os, and I am final-year student of the Aerospace Engineering degree at the University of Vigo.

I am currently working on numerous projects related with my studies and specially with the sector in which I am envolved. One of those
is **UVigo Aerotech**, the University of Vigo's Aero Design team where I am the Team Leader. Here, we design and manufacture wing-fixed drones with the aim of participate in international competitions and contest using modern engineering methods.

Over the last few years, I have developed a strong interest in everything related to software solutions for the aerospace industry, such as computational fluid dynamics or advanced optimisation algorithms. But, on top of all these, I have developed a special interest in **artificial intelligence** and everything that relates it to engineering. That is why I am learning about this topic and looking to apply it on my own projects, which I hope to show you here :) 

For now, I am just a visitor trying to learn about everything and everyone!
