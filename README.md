#### Hi everyone!

Mi name is Pablo Magari√±os, and I am final-year student of the Aerospace Engineering degree at the University of Vigo.

I am currently working on numerous projects related with my studies and specially with the sector in which I am envolved. One of those
is **UVigo Aerotech**, the University of Vigo's Aero Design team where I am the Team Leader. Here, we design and manufacture wing-fixed drones with the aim of participate in international competitions and contest using modern engineering methods.

My technical expertise spans flight mechanics, computer-based solutions like Computational Fluid Dynamics, and composites manufacturing. But what really excites me is the realm of **Artificial Intelligence**. I have foundation in developing AI algorithms, with hands-on experience in Python and MATLAB. That is why I am learning about this topic and looking to apply it on my own projects, which I hope to show you here :)
