#### Hi everyone

Mi name is Pablo MagariÃ±os, and I am Aerospace Engineer, studying a MSc in Industrial Mathematics at the University Carlos III de Madrid.

During my degree studies, I spent three years on **UVigo Aerotech**, the University of Vigo's Aero Design team where I were the **Team Leader**. Here, we design and manufacture wing-fixed drones with the aim of participate in international competitions and contest using modern engineering methods.

My current projects centre on the development of **autonomous agents and collective intelligence systems** â€” which I like to refer to as a *hive mind*. This concept goes far beyond traditional AI: by enabling decentralised, coordinated decision-making, **the hive mind architecture can vastly surpass individual human capabilities in both speed and complexity**. 

This vision has been the foundation for the creation of **XISTRA**, a platform built to translate these ideas into high-impact, real-world applications!
